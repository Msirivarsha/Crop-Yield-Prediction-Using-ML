Crop Yield Prediction This project aims to predict crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural factors.

Developed predictive models using advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, Random
Forest, and AdaBoost, to forecast crop yield based on district, state, season, and crop type data.

Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization using Python libraries such
as Pandas,NumPy, and Scikit-learn, ensuring high accuracy and eciency in predictions.

Visualized model performance and crop yield trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing farmers
with actionable insights for optimizing crop selection and agricultural planning
